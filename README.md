# Intro
The devcontainer from OneFootball data engineering. The first `devcontainer` in `src` installs software, dotfiles, and repos. The image is published in Github. The second `devcontainer` in `.devcontainer` runs the published image and it has the list of the repos used by the team.

# Setup

# inside the container
zellij attach --create <name of the session>
emacs
# check the creation of the devcontainer for problems
tail -f /workspaces/.codespaces/.persistedshare/creation.log
# Vscode development
gh cs code
```

# Development
The common operations are adding or updating `dotfiles` or adding new software. Add a new dotfile to `src/.devcontainer/dotfiles` and add a new entry to `src/.devcontainer/dd.edn`. New software is installed in `src/.devcontainer/local-features/of/install.sh`. Every change requires to publish a new image and the sha of the image needs to be committed to `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
``` sh
# local feature development
bb build
bb up
```

# Tricks
The build takes more than 30 mins. To speed up the inner loop, we leverage docker caching and we temporary disable steps in the build itself `src/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`

# Publish
The token generated by Github for Codespaces cannot push an image to `ghcr`. You can create a personal token and login again.

``` sh
bb push
```

# Secrets
The following secrets need to be created in https://github.com/settings/codespaces of the user creating the codespace.

``` sh
ATUIN_LOGIN=atuin login -u USER -p PASSWORD -k PASSPHRASE
# permissions needed
# codespace, gist, read:org, repo, workflow, write:packages
GHP_TOKEN=ghp_xxx
```
